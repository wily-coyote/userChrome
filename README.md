I recently switched to LibreWolf from Firefox and had to abandon my previous
theme for what I have now.

This repo is that theme. It's a version of the default Firefox Quantum theme
without all the godawful padding everywhere. Also it has native coloring (i.e.
Windows Classic Theme) using CSS system colors.

This theme also uses userchromeJS to modify the blank and newtab pages.
