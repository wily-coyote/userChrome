I recently switched to LibreWolf from Firefox and had to abandon my previous
theme for what I have now.

This repo is that theme. It's a version of the default Firefox Quantum theme
without all the godawful padding everywhere. Also it has native coloring (i.e.
Windows Classic Theme) using CSS system colors.

There are some other CSS files that I use to customize my browser. If anyone
knows how to inject custom JavaScript code into the browser UI, please let me
know.
